The component is currently being used in two different places, the home page and the tutorials page. When refactoring the component, I accidentally broke the component on the homepage in a way that the bottom button wasn't with the correct string (access or soon). To prevent this from happening again, let's write a test to ensure the component works as expected everywhere it's used."
